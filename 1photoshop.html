    <div> This is my julian opie selfie. I started with my school ID picture and using a bunch of different tools and variations of them. A very important aspect of this project was layers. To work on the right layer was important becuase when using tools such as the paint bucket tool. I ran into issues when i couldn't colour them certain areas in because I was trying to do so on the incorrect layer</div>
