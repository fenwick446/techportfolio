    PHOTOSHOP TASKS


</div>
    
    <p> 
    In photoshop we started off with creating our own Julian Opie Selfie. This task helped us learn the basics of photoshop and how to use different tools. After we got a hold of adobe photoshop we then created our own Beth Hoeckle imgae. this taskw as a little more complicated than the first as it used a wider range of tools and images.</p>
