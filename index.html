    PHOTOSHOP TASKS


</div>
    
    <div class="text9"> 
    In photoshop we started off with creating our own Julian Opie Selfie. This task helped us learn the basics of photoshop and how to use different tools. After we got a hold of adobe photoshop we then created our own Beth Hoeckle imgae. this taskw as a little more complicated than the first as it used a wider range of tools and images.</div>
    
    
    <div class="text10"> MICRO BIT TASK</div>
    
    <div class="text16">  Using block code I programed my micro bit to show a light pattern. after I got more confident we looked at programming Micro bits to flash light patterns in certain sequences. We looked at diferent instructions that we need give in order for robots to do as we want.</div>
    
    <div class="text17"> ANIMATION TASK</div>
    <div class="text18" In the animation unit we looked at different adobe programs such as adobe after effects, adobe illustartor and adobe animate. In order to complete this unit successfully we had to learn important steps such as file structure, rotoscoping, frame rate, the importance of different layering etc. To practise rotoscoping we used the program Adobe animate. This is where we traced over each frame to make an anmination We later completed our own rotoscoped animation using a personal video.</div>
